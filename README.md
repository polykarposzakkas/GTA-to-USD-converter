## GTA$ To USD Currency Converter      ##


This Python script provides a simple currency converter for converting between GTA$ (the in-game currency of the Grand Theft Auto series) and USD (United States Dollar). It allows users to input an amount in either currency and converts it to the equivalent amount in the other currency based on a predefined conversion rate.

### How it Works

1. **Menu Selection**: Upon running the script, users are presented with a menu offering two conversion options:
   - **Option 1**: Convert GTA$ to USD.
   - **Option 2**: Convert USD to GTA$.

2. **Input**: After selecting the desired conversion option, users are prompted to enter the amount they wish to convert.

3. **Conversion**: Depending on the selected option, the script performs the appropriate currency conversion using predefined conversion rates:
   - For GTA$ to USD conversion: Multiply the GTA$ amount by the conversion rate (0.00003).
   - For USD to GTA$ conversion: Multiply the USD amount by the inverse of the conversion rate (1/0.00003).

4. **Output**: The script displays the converted amount in the target currency, along with an appropriate message indicating the conversion result.

### Features

- **Dynamic Input**: Users can input the amount they want to convert, providing flexibility in the conversion process.
- **Error Handling**: The script handles invalid user input gracefully, notifying users of any incorrect choices.
- **Simple Interface**: The interface is straightforward, making it easy for users to understand and interact with the converter.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script (`currency_converter.py`) using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the desired conversion option and input the amount to convert.
5. View the conversion result displayed by the script.

### Dependencies
